# Fetch - Data Analyst Take Home

## Introduction
This repository contains my analysis for the Fetch Data Analyst Take-Home Exercise. The goal of this assessment is to explore a dataset, identify key data quality issues, answer analytical questions using SQL, and effectively communicate insights to stakeholders.

## Repository Structure
- `data/` - Contains the provided unstructured CSV files.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and visualization.
- `SQL.md` - SQL scripts used to answer the provided analytical questions.
- `Explore_the_Data.md` - Summary data quality issues.
- `README.md` - Overview of the project and instructions.

## Data Exploration
- Are there any data quality issues present?
- Are there any fields that are challenging to understand?

Approach:
- Used Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to explore the dataset.
- Identified missing values, inconsistencies, and potential data anomalies.
- Documented assumptions and challenges in the `findings/` folder.

## SQL
### Closed-ended questions:
1. **Top 5 brands by receipts scanned (Users 21+)**
2. **Top 5 brands by sales (Users with accounts > 6 months)**
3. **Percentage of sales in the Health & Wellness category by generation**

### Open-ended questions:
4. **Identifying Fetchâ€™s power users**
5. **Leading brand in the Dips & Salsa category**
