## - Are there any data quality issues present?
- Overall, there are many missing data. 
- For certain fields, their formats are not consistent, e.g. gender.


## - Are there any fields that are challenging to understand?

- Under `LANGUAGE`, I am not sure what `es-419` is.
- For `FINAL_QUANTITY` and `FINAL_SALE`, I am not sure why `FINAL_SALE` is `(Blanks)` when `FINAL_QUANTITY` is `1` and `FINAL_SALE` has a number when `FINAL_QUANTITY` is `zero`.
