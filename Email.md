Hi [Stakeholder's Name],

Hope you are doing well. I have completed an initial analysis of User and Transaction data, and I would like to share some key findings, trends and areas where I need your input or support to move forward.

Here are some key findings:
1. Fetch experienced significant growth from 2014 to 2022, with peak growth rates of 820% in 2017 and 236.65% in 2018. However, growth has declined in recent years, with a -42.31% drop in 2023 and a further -24.79% drop in 2024. This trend suggests a potential slowdown in user acquisition or retention that warrants further investigation.
2. Among users aged 21 and over, the top brands by receipts scanned are NERDS CANDY and DOVE (each with 6 receipts). By sales, CVS leads with $72 in total sales, followed by TRIDENT and DOVE.
3. Female users and Gen Z (ages 18-24) are Fetch’s most active user groups, contributing the highest number of receipts.
4. In the Health & Wellness category, Millennials and Gen X account for a small percentage of sales (0.02% and 0.03%, respectively), while a significant portion of sales (24.04%) are attributed to users with no generational data.
5. TOSTITOS is the leading brand in the Dips & Salsa category, with 72 receipts scanned.

Also, here are some data quality issues:
1. Many fields in the dataset are incomplete or missing. For example, a significant portion of users lack generational data, which limits our ability to analyze trends by demographic.
2. The LANGUAGE field includes values like es-419, which are unclear. I’m not sure what this represents, and it may require clarification.
3. The GENDER field has inconsistent formatting, making it challenging to categorize users accurately.
4. In the FINAL_QUANTITY and FINAL_SALE fields, there are inconsistencies:
    - FINAL_SALE is blank when FINAL_QUANTITY is 1.
    - FINAL_SALE has a value when FINAL_QUANTITY is 0.
  This inconsistency raises questions about how these fields are calculated or populated.


I also found that Fetch’s user base grew exponentially from 2014 to 2022, but the recent decline in growth (2023 and 2024) suggests a need to revisit user acquisition and retention strategies. This could involve exploring new marketing channels, improving user engagement, or addressing potential churn factors.

To further refine this analysis and address the data quality issues, I may need the following:
- Can we investigate why a significant portion of users lack generational data? Is this a data collection issue or a result of user privacy settings?
- What does es-419 in the LANGUAGE field represent?
- Can we clarify the logic behind the FINAL_QUANTITY and FINAL_SALE fields? Why are there discrepancies between these fields?
- Are there any known changes in marketing, product offerings, or external factors (e.g., competition) that could explain the decline in user growth?
- If available, data on user churn, marketing campaign performance, or customer feedback could help us better understand the recent trends.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss these findings further or if there is anything you would like me to explore. I am happy to set up a meeting with you to dive deeper into the data and align on next steps.

Thank you,
Luming
