Hi [Stakeholder's Name],

Hope you are doing well. I have completed an initial analysis of User and Transaction data, and I would like to share some key findings, trends and areas where I need your input or support to move forward.

Here are some key findings:
1. Fetch experienced significant growth from 2014 to 2022, with peak growth rates of 820% in 2017 and 236.65% in 2018. However, growth has declined in recent years, with a -42.31% drop in 2023 and a further -24.79% drop in 2024. This trend suggests a potential slowdown in user acquisition or retention that warrants further investigation.
2. Among users aged 21 and over, the top brands by receipts scanned are NERDS CANDY and DOVE (each with 6 receipts). By sales, CVS leads with $72 in total sales, followed by TRIDENT and DOVE.
3. Female users and Gen Z (ages 18-24) are Fetchâ€™s most active user groups, contributing the highest number of receipts.
4.
